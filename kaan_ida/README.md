Practical work - gollum
=======================

This binary is a crackme with several levels: each level requires you to give an input, and then validate or invalidate your input.

Analyze the binary and find the correct answer for each level. The binary will display green sentences if your answer is correct, red sentences otherwise. You need to write a report which details the approach used to find each answer, the difficulties you encountered and the hypothesis you made on the internals of the level.
You can provide intuitions and observations on levels even if you could not find the answer.

We encourage you to use screenshots and code blocks, as it's often more clear than a descriptive text.

The final report should be sent as a PDF file to the mail address (provided during the lab) during the week following the lab.
